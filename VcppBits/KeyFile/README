A simple ini-like file parser

File syntax looks like this:

top_level_setting VALUE
pi_equals_around 3.141593
[section1]
setting_within_section1 can have just unquoted text
[section2]
# comments start with hash sign
foo 11
[section2]
# section names can be repeated
bar 22
# end of example

Allowing to repeat section names makes it possible to define multiple entities
of the same type -- can be extremely useful for some domains: section name just
specifies the type of the element, like this:

[person]
name Bob
phone_number 123456789
[person]
name Alice
phone_number 234567890
# end of example
